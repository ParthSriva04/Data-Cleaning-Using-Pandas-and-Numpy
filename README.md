# Data-Cleaning-Using-Pandas-and-Numpy
# Cleaned Datasets

This repository contains two datasets that have undergone a comprehensive data cleaning and analysis process. The goal was to enhance data quality, consistency, and readability for ease of understanding and analysis.

## Common Data Cleaning Steps

The following general data cleaning steps were applied to both datasets:

### 1. Removing Duplicates

- Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Changing Data Types

- Adjusted data types to align with their expected types (e.g., numerical, categorical).

### 3. Consistent Data Formatting and Standardization

- Ensured consistent data formatting and applied standardization for uniformity.

### 4. Handling Missing Values

- Addressed missing values using [specific strategies, e.g., imputation or removal].

### 5. Unwanted Characters Removal

- Removed unwanted characters and inconsistencies in text-based columns.
